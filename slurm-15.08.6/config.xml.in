  <description>The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an 
  open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
  scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters. SLURM requires no 
  kernel modifications for its operation and is relatively self-contained. 
  As a cluster resource manager, SLURM has three key functions. First, it 
  allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) 
  to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it 
  provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally 
  a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates 
  conflicting requests for resources by managing a queue of pending work.
