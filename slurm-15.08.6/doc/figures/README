Most of these diagrams (with the ".dia" suffix) were built using the 
tool "dia" (http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/).

gnuplot is used with "times.gpl" and ".dat" suffix files to build a 
timing plot.

The PostScript images of these can be built as needed by the Makefile 
in "../jsspp" and "../pubdesign".
