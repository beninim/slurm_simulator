<h2><a name="user_guide">User Guide</a></h2>

<p>This document describes the unique features of Slurm on Cray
  computers natively, or without the use of Cray's Application Level
  Placement Scheduler (ALPS).  You should be familiar with the Slurm's
  mode of operation on Linux clusters before studying the differences
  in Cray system operation described in this document.  When running
  Slurm in native mode a Cray system will function very similar to a
  Linux cluster.
</p>

<p>Since version 14.03, Slurm is designed to operate as a workload
  manager on Cray XC systems (Cascade) without the use of ALPS.  In
  addition to providing the same look and feel of a regular Linux
  cluster this also allows for many functionalities previously not
  available, such as...
<ul>
<li>Ability to run multiple jobs per node.</li>
<li>Ability to status running jobs with sstat</li>
<li>Full accounting support for job steps</li>
<li>Ability to run multiple jobs/steps in background from the same
  session</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="features">Cray Specific Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Network Performance Counters</li>
<p>
  To access Cray's Network Performance Counters (NPC) you can use
  the <i>--network</i> option in sbatch/salloc/srun to request them.
  There are 2 different types of counters, system and blade.
<p>
  For the system option (--network=system) only one job can use system at
  a time.   Only nodes requested will be marked in use for the job
  allocation.  If the job does not fill up the entire system the rest
  of the nodes are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if
  idle their state will appear as PerfCnts.  These nodes are still
  available for other jobs not using NPC.
</p>
<p>
  For the blade option (--network=blade) Only nodes requested
  will be marked in use for the job allocation.  If the job does not
  fill up the entire blade(s) allocated to the job those blade(s) are not
  able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if idle their state will appear as
  PerfCnts.  These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.
</p>

<li>Core Specialization</li>
<p>
  To use set <b><i>CoreSpecPlugin=core_spec/cray</i></b>.
  Ability to reserve a number of cores allocated to the job for system
  operations and not used by the application. The application will not
  use these cores, but will be charged for their allocation.
</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="admin_guide">Admin Guide</a></h2>
<p>
  Many new plugins were added to utilize the Cray system without
  ALPS.  These should be set up in your slurm.conf outside of your
  normal configuration.
<ul>

<li>BurstBuffer</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>BurstBufferPlugins=burst_buffer/cray</i></b> to use.
  The burst buffer capability on Cray systems is also known by the name
  <i>DataWarp</i>.
  For more information, see
  <a href="burst_buffer.html">Slurm Burst Buffer Guide</a>.
</p>

<li>CoreSpec</li>
<p>
  To use set <b><i>CoreSpecPlugin=core_spec/cray</i></b>.
</p>

<li>JobSubmit</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>JobSubmitPlugins=job_submit/cray</i></b> to use.
  This plugin is primarily used to set a gres=craynetwork value which
  is used to limit the number of applications that can run on a node
  at once.  For a node without MICs on it that number at most is 4.
  Nodes with MICs the number drops to 2.  This craynetwork gres needs
  to be set up in your slurm.conf to ensure proper functionality.
  In example...
  <pre>
    ...
    Grestypes=craynetwork
    NodeName=nid000[00-10] gres=craynetwork:4 #node without MIC
    NodeName=nid000[11-20] gres=craynetwork:2 #node with MIC
    ...
  </pre>
</p>

<li>Power</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>PowerPlugin=power/cray</i></b> to use.
  <b><i>PowerParameters</i></b> is also typically configured.
  For more information, see
  <a href="power_mgmt.html">Slurm Power Management Guide</a>.
</p>

<li>Proctrack</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>ProctrackType=proctrack/cray</i></b> to use.
</p>

<li>Select</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>SelectType=select/cray</i></b> to use.  This plugin is
  a layered plugin.  Which means it enhances a lower layer select
  plugin.  By default it is layered on top of the <i>select/linear</i>
  plugin.  It can also be layered on top of the <i>select/cons_res</i> plugin
  by using the <b><i>SelectTypeParameters=other_cons_res</i></b>,
  doing this will allow you to run multiple jobs on a Cray node just
  like on a normal Linux cluster.
  Use additional <b><i>SelectTypeParameters</i></b> to identify the resources
  to allocate (e.g. cores, sockets, memory, etc.). See the slurm.conf man
  page for details.
</p>

<li>Switch</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>SwitchType=switch/cray</i></b> to use.
</p>

<li>Task</li>
<p>
  Set <b><i>TaskPlugin=cray</i></b> to use.
  It is advised to use this in conjunction with other task plugins
  such as the <i>task/cgroup</i> plugin.  This can be done in this
  manner, <b><i>TaskPlugin=cgroup,cray</i></b>, you can also
  use the <i>task/affinity</i> plugin if wanted with <i>task/cray</i>
  or the combination of all three depending on how you want your
  system configured (i.e <b><i>TaskPlugin=cgroup,affinity,cray</i></b>).  The
  plugins are used in the order they are defined in the comma
  separated list.
</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="setup">Cray system setup</a></h2>
<p>Some Slurm plugins (burst_buffer/cray and power/cray) plugins
parse JSON format data.
These plugins are designed to make use of the JSON-C library for this purpose.
See <a href="download.html#json">JSON-C installation instructions</a> for
details.</p>

<p>
  Some services on the system need to be set up to run correctly with
  Slurm.  Below is how to restart the service and the nodes they run
  on.  It is probably a good idea to set this up to happen automatically.
<ul>
  <li>boot node</li>
  <ul>
    <li>WLM_DETECT_ACTIVE=SLURM /etc/init.d/aeld restart</li>
  </ul>
  <li>sdb node</li>
  <ul>
    <li>WLM_DETECT_ACTIVE=SLURM /etc/init.d/ncmd restart</li>
    <lI>WLM_DETECT_ACTIVE=SLURM /etc/init.d/apptermd restart</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  As with Linux clusters you will need to start a slurmd on each of your
  compute nodes.  If you choose to use munge authentication, advised,
  you will also need munge installed and a munged running on each of
  your compute nodes as well.  See the <a href="quickstart_admin.html">
  quick start guide</a> for more info.  Outside of the differences
  listed in this file it can be used to set up your Cray system to run
  Slurm natively.
</p>

<h2><a name="ha">High Availability</a></h2>
<p>
A backup controller can be setup in or outside the Cray. However, when the
backup is within the Cray, both the primary and the backup controllers will go
down when the Cray is rebooted. It is best to setup the backup controller on a
Cray external node so that the controller can still receive new jobs when the
Cray is down.  When the backup is configured on an external node the
<b><i>no_backup_scheduling</i></b> <b><i>SchedulerParameter</i></b> should be
specified in the slurm.conf. This allows new jobs to be submitted while the Cray
is down and prevents any new jobs from being started.
