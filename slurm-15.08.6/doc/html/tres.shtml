<h1>Trackable RESources (TRES)</h1>

<p>A TRES is a resource that can be tracked for usage or used to enforce
  limits against.  A TRES is a combination of a Type and a Name.
  Types are predefined.

Current TRES Types are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>BB (burst buffers)</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>GRES</li>
<li>License</li>
<li>Mem (Memory)</li>
<li>Node</li>
</ul>

<h2>slurm.conf settings</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>AccountingStorageTRES</b>
<p>Used to define which TRES are
  to be tracked on the system. By default CPU, Energy, Memory and Node
  are tracked.  This will be the case whether specified or not. The
  following example:
</p>
  <pre>AccountingStorageTRES=gres/craynetwork,license/iop1,bb/cray</pre>
<p>
  will track cpu, energy, memory and nodes along with a GRES called craynetwork
  as well as a license called iop1.  It will also track usage on a
  Cray burst buffer. Whenever these resources are used on the
  cluster they are recorded. TRES are automatically set up in the database
  on the start of the slurmctld.
</p>

<p> The TRES that require associated names are BB, GRES, and
  License.  As seen in the above example, GRES and License are typically
  different on each system.  The BB TRES is named the same as
  the burst buffer plugin being used. In the above example we are using the
  <i>Cray</i> burst buffer plugin.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>PriorityWeightTRES</b>
<p>A comma separated list of TRES Types and weights that sets the
  degree that each TRES Type contributes to the job's priority.</p>
<pre>PriorityWeightTRES=CPU=1000,Mem=2000,GRES/gpu=3000</pre>

<p>Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor and if
AccountingStorageTRES is configured with each TRES Type.
The default values are 0.</p>
</li>

<li><b>TRESBillingWeights</b>
<p>For each partition this option is used to define the billing
  weights of each TRES type that will be used in calculating the usage
  of a job.
</p>

<p>Billing weights are specified as a comma-separated list of
<i>TRES=Weight</i> pairs.
</p>

<p>Any TRES Type is available for billing. Note that the base unit for memory
and burst buffers is megabytes.
</p>

<p>By default the billing of TRES is calculated as the sum of all TRES types
multiplied by their corresponding billing weight.
</p>

<p>The weighted amount of a resource can be adjusted by adding a suffix of
K,M,G,T or P after the billing weight. For example, a memory weight of "mem=.25"
on a job allocated 8GB will be billed 2048 (8192MB *.25) units. A memory weight
of "mem=.25G" on the same job will be billed 2 (8192MB * (.25/1024)) units.
</p>

<p>When a job is allocated 1 CPU and 8 GB of memory on a partition configured
with:
</p>

<pre>TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1.0,Mem=0.25G,GRES/gpu=2.0"</pre>

<p>the billable TRES will be:
</p>
<pre>(1*1.0) + (8*0.25) + (0*2.0) = 3.0</pre>

<p>If <i>PriorityFlags=MAX_TRES</i> is configured, the billable TRES is
  calculated as the MAX of individual TRES' on a node (e.g. cpus, mem,
  gres) plus the sum of all global TRES' (e.g. licenses). Using the
  same example above, the billable TRES will be:
</p>
<pre>MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25) + (0*2.0) = 2.0</pre>

<p>If TRESBillingWeights is not defined then the job is billed against the total
number of allocated CPUs.
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> TRESBillingWeights is only used when calculating fairshare and
doesn't affect job priority directly as it is currently not used for the size of
the job. If you want TRES' to play a role in the job's priority then refer to
the PriorityWeightTRES option.
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> As with PriorityWeightTRES only TRES defined in
  AccountingStorageTRES are available for TRESBillingWeights.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>sacct</h2>
<p>sacct can be used to view the TRES of each job by adding "tres" to the
  --format option.
</p>

<h2>sacctmgr</h2>
<p>sacctmgr is used to view the various TRES available globally in the
  system. <i>sacctmgr show tres</i> will do this.
</p>

<h2>sreport</h2>
<p>Before 15.08, sreport would only report on CPU usage.  It will now
  work on different TRES.  Simply using the comma separated input
  option <i>--tres=</i> will have sreport generate reports available
  for the requested TRES types.  More information about these reports
  can be found on the <a href="sreport.html">sreport manpage</a>.
