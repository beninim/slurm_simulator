We were able to perform some SLURM tests on a 1000 node cluster at LLNL.
Some development was still underway at that time and 
tuning had not been performed. The results for executing simple 'hostname' program 
on two tasks per node and various node counts is show 
in Figure~\ref{timing}. We found SLURM performance to be comparable 
to the Quadrics Resource Management System (RMS)~\cite{RMS} 
for all job sizes and about 80 times faster than IBM 
LoadLeveler~\cite{LoadLevelerWeb,LoadLevelerManual} at tested job sizes.
