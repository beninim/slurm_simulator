.SH "NAME"
acct_gather.conf \- Slurm configuration file for the acct_gather plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBacct_gather.conf\fP is an ASCII file which defines parameters used by
Slurm's acct_gather related plugins.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The file will always be located in the
same directory as the \fBslurm.conf\fP file.
.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the general
behavior of various plugins in Slurm.

.LP
The acct_gather.conf file is different than other Slurm .conf files.  Each
plugin defines which options are available.  So if you do not load the
respective plugin for an option that option will appear to be unknown by Slurm
and could cause Slurm not to load.  If you decide to change plugin types you
might also have to change the related options as well.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMI\fR
Options used for AcctGatherEnergyType/ipmi are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBEnergyIPMIFrequency\fR=<number>
This parameter is the number of seconds between BMC access samples.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMICalcAdjustment\fR=<yes|no>
If set to "yes", the consumption between the last BMC access sample and
a step consumption update is approximated to get more accurate task consumption.
The adjustment is made at the step start and each time the
consumption is updated, including the step end. The approximations are not
accumulated, only the first and last adjustments are used to calculated the
consumption. The default is "no".

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPowerSensors\fR=<key=values>\fR
Optionally specify the ids of the sensors to used.
Multiple <key=values> can be set with ";" separators.
The key "Node" is mandatory and is used to know the consumed energy for nodes
(scontrol show node) and jobs (sacct).
Other keys are optional and are named by administrator.
These keys are useful only when profile is activated for energy to store power
(in watt) of each key.
<values> are integers, multiple values can be set with "," separators.
The sum of the listed sensors is used for each key.
EnergyIPMIPowerSensors is optional, default value is "Node=number" where
"number" is the id of the first power sensor returned by ipmi-sensors.

.LP
The following acct_gather.conf parameters are defined to control the
IPMI config default values for libipmiconsole.

.TP 10
\fBEnergyIPMIUsername\fR=\fIUSERNAME\fR
Specify BMC Username.

.TP
\fBEnergyIPMIPassword\fR=\fIPASSWORD\fR
Specify BMC Password.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5\fR
Options used for AcctGatherProfileType/hdf5 are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBProfileHDF5Dir\fR=<path>
This parameter is the path to the shared folder into which the
acct_gather_profile plugin will write detailed data (usually as an HDF5 file).
The directory is assumed to be on a file system shared by the controller and
all compute nodes. This is a required parameter.

.TP
\fBProfileHDF5Default\fR
A comma delimited list of data types to be collected for each job submission.
Allowed values are:

.RS
.TP 8
\fBAll\fR
All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBNone\fR
No data types are collected. This is the default.
(Cannot be combined with other values.)

.TP
\fBEnergy\fR
Energy data is collected.

.TP
\fBFilesystem\fR
File system (Lustre) data is collected.

.TP
\fBNetwork\fR
Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

.TP
\fBTask\fR
Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

.RE
.RE

.TP
\fBInfinibandOFED\fR
Options used for AcctGatherInfinbandType/ofed are as follows:

.RS
.TP 10
\fBInfinibandOFEDPort\fR=<number>
This parameter represents the port number of the local Infiniband card that we are willing to monitor.
The default port is 1.
