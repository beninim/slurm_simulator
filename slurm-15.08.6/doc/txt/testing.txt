SLURM Testing Intrastructure
----------------------------

The testing infrastructure for SLURM is based on Dejagnu, and consequently on
expect/tcl.  

Directory Structure
-------------------
The entire testing infrastructure is located under the slurm/testsuite 
directory.  

testsuite/config 
	contains the default config files for dejagnu.

testsuite/slurm_unit 
	Has a directory structure that mirrors slurm/src, and 
	contains the unit test cases for them.  For example, the directory 
	slurm_unit/common will contain unit test cases for modules located in 
	src/common.  

testsuite/slurm*
	any directory starting with slurm may contain testcases to run.  Dejagnu
	will find and execute an ".exp" files that are located in the slurm* 
	directories, and any of it's subdirectories.


Testing Scripts
---------------
Drop in a .exp file into a testsuite/slurm[*] directory.  Dejagnu will 
automagically run it when either "make check" or "runtest" are executed.
By using the functions pass, fail, untested, unresolved, and note to express
the results of test cases, DejaGNU records these results and prints out
summaries of all test cases. 

Unit Testing
------------
To unit test using our infrastructure, 

#include <testsuite/dejagnu.h>

pass( char*, ... )
fail( char*, ... )
untested( char*, ... )
unresolved( char*, ... )
note( char*, ... )

totals() 

Note: All of the funtctions, except totals, behave like printf.

There is a runall.exp that will be placed in every unit testing directory,
that will run all programs that end with "test".  If you have special needs 
from the launching test script, you must write your own.  If you write your
own .exp file to launch your scipts, please use names that do not end in
"test" to avoid strange resluts.
